Formerly a 'working waterfront'and superfund site, the Esplanade now welcomes recreation and residence with the Museum of Glass, Marinas, walk/bike paths and sculpture.  In this discrete area of the esplanade, Elizabeth reclaimed artifacts that would have been used on the waterfront and transformed them.  After painting them various shades of green and embellishing them with botanical images of native plants, she 'planted' the artifacts within a landscaped walkway along the water.",
